How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

The rate structures are similar and both offer easy funding options through established Canadian banks.

## Recommendations

If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* To continue to grow the customer base in Canada and offer additional value to the Canadian Crypto market it would be recommended that Coinberry continue to expand the number of crypto currencies on offer.

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* It's important for Coinberry to offer additonal crypto's to maintain a significant customer base.  Some customers will stay and HODL but many will withdraw crypto and move to largers exchanges.  Additionally, the relative importance of the coins currently offered by Coinberry is quickly eroding compared to the new more exotic and exciting coin & projects that are being developed in the DeFi space.  

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* It's difficult to confirm if this would require any new technologies or just exted and build on the current capabilities and tech that Coinberry is already employing.

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* In order to compete with the larger exchanges (Binance, Kraken, Cryto.com, etc.) and maintain custodianship of the crypto assets.  As many users utilize Coinberry to launch into the Crypto space but quickly withdraw and move their assets to large exchanges that offer additional crypto currencies (coins), trading, options and futures.
